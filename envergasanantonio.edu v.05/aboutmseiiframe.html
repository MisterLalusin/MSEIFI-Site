History
<br><br>
Two years after the town of San Antonio became a district municipality from Tiaong, Quezon, the Board of Trustees autorized the opening of luzonian high school in 1959 , The town mayor Juanito C. Wagan , felt the need to open a local high school that would benefit his young constituents.
<br><br>With a delegation, Mayor Wagan went to the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Luzonian Colleges, Dr. Manuel S. Enverga, to convince him to put up a high school in San Antonio. The request was granted and the school was opened on June 22,1959.
<br><br>Because the citizens of the town saw the need to send their children to high school, Vice mayor Casiano Harina graciously offered his building to be the site of the first school. The following year, the Luzonian high school had it's own two-story building with complete facilities. Mr. Pablo Alhambra was the first principal and he recruited six teachers to join him.
<br><br>In 1962, Mrs. Soledad Anenias assumed the position of Director-Principal. After five years of fruitful service, she resigned her post and was succeeded by Mr. Amado H. Bolilia who served as Director-Principal until his death on August 18, 1989, Mr. Amado Bolilia was a dynamic leader who expanded the influence of the school outside it's boundaries. He encouraged the students to take part in provincial, regional and national competitions in sports, writing, music, art and public speaking.
<br><br>Mr. Bolilia's leadership brought about a harvest of outstanding graduates who eventually became successful after graduation from college. A few years later, the school would have a policy of inviting its alumni to be. Commencement day speakers. Through the years many successful graduates have shared their post-high school life experiences and their formulas for success to their young peers.
<br><br>After the death of Mr. Bolilia, a new principal was appointed, Mr. Ricardo Lagrosa. He stayed for some time; thus, Mrs. Paula Laylo was designated principal until her retirement. She was succeeded by Ms. Remedios L. Real and Ms. Mary jane Carandang. At present MSEIFI is under the supervision of the acting principal, Dr. Carmelita L. Ti&#324;ana. Joining her is a new breed of teachers. Together, they strive hard to uplifting instruction through relevant learning and teaching strategies. Further , the school administration aims to develop the holistic abilities of it's students by providing varied academic and cocurricular activities in various areas outside the town and the province.
